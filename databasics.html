    <h2>DataBasic.io and St Paul Public Library</h2>
	
	<p><a href=https://databasic.io/>DataBasic.io</a> is a suite of tools and activities to help people understand 
	and work with data, a valuable skill set in this age of data and visualization. Activities include hands-on 
	workshops developed to help people learn data literacy concepts in safe, engaging, familiar ways. Through this 
	residency exchange, the DataBasic.io team will iterate on existing workshops and design new ones in collaboration 
	with St Paul Public Library, an active community hub for supporting data and information literacy skills. During 
	the residency, the team will develop documentation and toolkits for their activities, identify topics and data sets 
	best for introductions in the library setting, and incorporate data literacy resources into existing library programming.</p>
