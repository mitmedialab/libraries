    Transforming the Learning Experience Together: Public Libraries Team Up with the MIT Media Lab
  description: >
    How do we bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology innovation and hands-on community experience? By pairing tech researchers with librarians, of course! The Public Library Innovation Exchange is a Knight Foundation funded project to build collaborations between MIT Media Lab researchers and public libraries across the U.S. In this session, Media Lab researchers and librarians who participated in the exchange will share their experiences and give demos of their work.
