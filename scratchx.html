    <h2>ScratchX and Richland Library</h2>
	
	<p>The <a href=http://scratchx.org/ target='_blank'>ScratchX</a> team is building experimental extensions to 
	<a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/ target='_blank'>Scratch</a>, a programming language and online community 
	for creating your own interactive stories, games, and animations. ScratchX extensions allow you to connect your 
	Scratch projects to external hardware such as the <a href=https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-101 target='_blank'>Arduino/Genuino 101</a> 
	board with a built in tilt sensor and Bluetooth connectivity to interface your projects with the physical world. 
	During this residency exchange, the ScratchX team will work with librarians from the Richland Library to create 
	new programs for teaching novice coders, develop documentation and toolkits for existing activities, 
	identify new ScratchX tools that would be valuable for community learning, and test a train-the-trainer workshop 
	to help interested librarians feel comfortable facilitating these activities in their communities.</p>
