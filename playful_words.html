    <h2>Playful Words and Boston Public Library</h2>
	
	<p><a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/playful-words/overview/ target='_blank'>Playful Words</a> is designing tools 
	for children to develop skills in self-expression, literacy, and dialog through natural mediums of written 
	language, pictures, and stories. This group is working with Boston Public Library to gain an understanding 
	of how to integrate <a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/speech-blocks/overview/ target='_blank'><i>SpeechBlocks</i></a> 
	and other Playful Words tools into existing community networks. The group is working with community partners 
	and families to design these tools and define the role of what they call a Family Learning Coach. The exchange 
	aims to create workshops and activities to support learning using Playful Words tools, help Family Learning 
	Coaches learn to facilitate child and parent engagement, create tutoring programs to support early learning, 
	and incorporate <i>SpeechBlocks</i> and <i>StoryBlocks</i> literacy tools into storytime for children and families.</p>
