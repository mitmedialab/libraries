    <h2>Space Exploration Initiative, Charlotte Mecklenburg Library, and Cambridge Public Library</h2>

    <p>	The <a href=https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-exploration/overview/ target='_blank'>Space Exploration Initiative</a> was founded in the 
	2016-2017 academic year with the vision of making spacing more accessible 
	to more people through the reach of DIY instrument, experiments, sensors, satellites, and a new age of space exploration. 
	This initiative is geared to create and deploy the ideas that seem impossible today by working beyond the rational constraints of 
	most academic grants. One of their goals is to develop outreach programs, which includes a pilot Climate CubeSat Co-building Outreach 
	Program with a group of Boston-area high schoolers. Cambridge Public Library and the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library are teaming up with 
	the Space Initiative to adapt the CubeSat program materials and create workshops for libraries to engage community members with space 
	exploration technologies. The details of this residency exchange are still in development, so stay tuned for updates!</p>
